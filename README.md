💡 Ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence can understand sign language and convert it into text in real-time?
In this video, I’ll show you how I built a Sign Language to Text Translator using Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Machine Learning — a complete end-to-end Computer Vision AI project. 🎯

We’ll go step by step:
✅ Preprocessing hand gesture and sign language images ✋
✅ Training a deep learning model with TensorFlow & Keras
✅ Integrating the model with a Flask web application
✅ Adding real-time webcam support for live translation
✅ Deploying the project inside a Docker container 🐳

This is a full AI + Machine Learning project, perfect for students, developers, or anyone building a strong portfolio in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

✨ By the end of this video, you’ll learn how to:
• Build an end-to-end Flask + AI web app
• Train and test a model for gesture recognition
• Convert sign language into readable text instantly
• Deploy your entire project using Docker for scalability

📌 Technologies Used: Python, Flask, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Docker

💬 If you’re starting in AI or Machine Learning, this tutorial will show you how to turn a real-world problem into a working, interactive web application!
